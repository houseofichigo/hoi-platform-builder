  storyHeader:
    "Prompts are infrastructure. They are how intent, data, and context turn into reliable output. Most teams think they are testing AI. They are actually testing prompt quality. Today we build three prompts — one per data layer from M02 — and document them so they survive past the first session.",

  step1: {
    title: "Prompt architecture — two questions before you write anything",
    why:
      "Before you write a prompt, decide where it lives and what job it does. Placement defines authority — a user prompt can be ignored, a system prompt cannot. Task type defines behaviour — extraction is not the same job as classification or guardrails.",
    example:
      "For the OCR schema search prompt: placement is User (we run it ad-hoc during research). Task type is Search + Summarisation + Transformation (we find docs, condense them, restructure into a knowledge base entry).",
    whatToNotice: [
      "User prompts trigger work. System prompts govern behaviour.",
      "Context prompts give evidence. Workflow prompts run inside automations.",
      "Most prompts have one primary task type — naming it sharpens the prompt.",
    ],
    produces: "Architecture decision — placement + task type for one OCR prompt",
    nextLabel: "Step 2 — the six-element ladder",
  },

  step2: {
    title: "The six-element ladder — same model, same invoice, six prompts",
    why:
      "Prompt quality compounds. Each element removes a different kind of uncertainty: Task gives direction, Role frames the lens, Context aligns the output, Constraints prevent failure modes, Output format makes the result usable, Examples teach the standard. Watch one OCR prompt evolve from V1 to V6.",
    example:
      "Same invoice, same model, six versions of the prompt. The only thing that changes is the prompt — but the output goes from a loose paragraph (V1) to validated JSON with edge-case handling (V6).",
    whatToNotice: [
      "Each rung removes a specific failure mode named in the right-hand column",
      "Examples (V6) remove ambiguity faster than explanation",
      "Higher-token cost (V6) is the trade — you pay for reliability with context length",
    ],
    produces: "Understanding of how the six elements compound",
    nextLabel: "Step 3 — write your three prompt entries",
  },

  step3: {
    title: "Write three prompt entries — one per data layer",
    why:
      "M02 produced a three-layer knowledge base blueprint. M03 builds the prompts that generate and test each layer's content. Schema search produces the internal-tool knowledge base entry. Context deep research produces the contextual accounting report. Mock data generation produces task-specific test cases. Three prompts, three layers, one library.",
    example:
      "Each prompt uses the six-element framework. Each entry also names one prompt-injection risk specific to the prompt (e.g. for mock data generation: 'a user could prompt me to generate a mock invoice that's actually a real supplier's invoice — refuse and request explicit anonymization').",
    whatToNotice: [
      "Each prompt targets a different M02 data layer",
      "Each prompt has a different placement and task type — Step 1 framing applies here",
      "Safety is per-prompt: injection risks differ between schema search and mock data",
    ],
    produces: "Three documented prompt entries — drafts ready for quality review",
    nextLabel: "Step 4 — quality bar review + complete",
  },

  step4: {
    title: "Quality bar self-review — file the library",
    why:
      "A prompt that works once is not a library entry. A library entry is documented: type, owner, version, when to use, when not to use, inputs, outputs, quality checks, safety risks, failures observed. Run the 10-item quality bar on each prompt before filing.",
    example:
      "The quality bar is not a polish step — it is a refusal-to-ship gate. If a prompt fails 'safety risks are named' or 'inputs and variables are defined', it goes back to Step 3, not to the library.",
    whatToNotice: [
      "Architecture, outputs, discipline — three habits that turn prompts into infrastructure",
      "Every checkbox must be intentional — 'yes' means you can defend the answer",
      "Failing the bar is not failing the assignment — re-drafting is the work",
    ],

      role: `You are an AP test data designer. You generate fully synthetic test invoices that exercise specific failure modes without exposing any real supplier, customer, or financial data.`,
