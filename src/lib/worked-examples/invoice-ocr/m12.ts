    "A working pilot is not a strategy. M12 turns the portfolio into the document an executive sponsor can sign.",

  step1: {
    title: "Portfolio → roadmap sequencing",
    why: "A scored portfolio without a sequence is a wish list. The roadmap sequences candidates across three horizons so capacity, dependencies, and governance can be planned, not assumed.",
    example:
      "Now (0-3m): scale invoice OCR to a second AP team. Next (3-9m): launch expense report triage; pilot supplier risk screening. Later (9-12m): contract clause extraction, contingent on legal sign-off and a new vector store.",
    whatToNotice: [
      "Each horizon answers a different question: deliver, prove, prepare",
      "Dependencies (data, governance, vendor) drive sequence — not enthusiasm",
      "Sequencing rationale names the capacity constraint, not just the priority",
    ],
    produces: "A now/next/later roadmap with sequencing rationale",
    nextLabel: "Step 2 — capability gaps",
  },

  step2: {
    title: "Capability gap analysis",
    why: "Roadmaps fail at the boundary between portfolio ambition and organisational capacity. Gaps in people, tools, partnerships, and governance are what slip the plan — name them and assign them now.",
    example:
      "People: no second AP lead trained on the assistant. Tools: vector store decision still open for legal corpus. Partnerships: deployment partner for accounting integration not under contract. Governance: EU AI Act technical documentation owner not named.",
    whatToNotice: [
      "Every gap has a named owner and a next action — not a category lead",
      "Partnerships and governance are first-class, not afterthoughts",
      "A gap with no owner is a roadmap risk, not a roadmap line",
    ],
    produces: "A capability gap matrix covering people, tools, partnerships, governance",
    nextLabel: "Step 3 — executive scorecard",
  },

  step3: {
    title: "Executive scorecard",
    why: "The sponsor needs one page to track program health across investment, risk, governance, and impact. The scorecard is the standing artifact between the roadmap and the next review.",
    example:
      "Live systems: 1. Pilots running: 2. Readiness review status: G2 passed for triage, G3 pending for risk screening. Forecast spend vs. M08 model: -5%. HITL load: stable. EU AI Act governance docs current: yes.",
    whatToNotice: [
      "Every metric has a target — not a wish",
      "Metrics span investment, risk, governance, and outcome",
      "The scorecard is short enough to read in a meeting",
    ],
    produces: "A selected scorecard with at least 6 metrics and explicit targets",
    nextLabel: "Step 4 — executive summary",
  },

  step4: {
    title: "Executive summary and next pilot cycle",
    why: "The summary is what the sponsor signs. It restates the portfolio bet, the roadmap, the gaps being closed, and the go/no-go criteria for the next pilot.",
    example:
      "We will scale invoice OCR, launch two new pilots (expense triage, supplier risk), and prepare contract clause extraction. Total ask: EUR 960k across 12 months. Stop conditions: accuracy regression on OCR, EU AI Act governance docs not closed by Q2, partnership unsigned by Q3.",
    whatToNotice: [
      "The summary names the bet, the price, and the stop conditions on one page",
      "Next-pilot criteria are explicit — sponsor knows when to greenlight",
      "Rollback and review cadence are stated, not implied",
